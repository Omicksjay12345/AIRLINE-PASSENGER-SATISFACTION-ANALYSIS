### Project Overview ###
Airline customer satisfaction is a key measure of operational performance and service delivery in the aviation industry. This project analyzes a real-world airline passenger satisfaction dataset, exploring how flight experience, delays, travel class, passenger demographics, and service ratings influence overall satisfaction.

### Project Scope ###
The project covers a comprehensive analysis of airline passenger satisfaction, including customer demographics, flight information, and service rating metrics. The analysis goes across the entire dataset, providing a detailed view of passenger experiences and operational performance across different customer groups and travel conditions.

### Project Objectives ###
The major objectives include:
- Data Understanding: Gain full insight into the structure, quality, and distribution of the dataset.
- Data Cleaning & Preparation: Ensure the dataset is accurate, consistent, and analysis-ready.
-	Exploratory Data Analysis: Examine trends, patterns, correlations, and potential business implications.
-	Service Performance Evaluation: Identify which service area influences satisfaction the most.
-	Operational Insight: Understand how flight delays, travel class, and passenger type affect satisfaction.
-	Data Storytelling: Use visuals that effectively communicate insights to stakeholders.

### Expected Outcome ###
By the end of the project:
-	A cleaned dataset ready for modeling is produced
-	Key factors in driving satisfaction are identified
-	Insightful visualizations highlight behavioral patterns
- Operational inefficiencies (e.g., delays) become clear
-	Actionable business recommendations are provided
Stakeholders will be able to answer:
-	What drives satisfaction?
-	Which service areas need improvement?
-	What customer segments are most satisfied or dissatisfied?

### Document Purpose ###
This documentation serves as:
-	A technical report summarizing all project steps
-	A reference for analysts evaluating the dataset
-	A portfolio piece demonstrating analytical competence
-	A business-oriented summary of findings and insights

### Use Case ###
This dataset is suitable for:
-	Customer Experience Analysis
-	Airline service quality evaluation
-	Predictive modeling
-	Operational performance monitoring
-	Business intelligence dashboard (Power BI)
  
Organizations can use this analysis for:
-	Policy and process improvement
-	Flight operations decision-making
-	Enhancing customer retention strategies
-	Identify areas with low service ratings.

### Data Source ###
The dataset for this project is obtained from [Maven Analytics platform](https://app.mavenanalytics.io/datasets?search=airline+passenger) and is intended for analytical practice. It is provided as a CSV file containing airline passenger satisfaction records, comprising customer demographics, flight information, and service quality metrics. The dataset includes essential attributes such as:
-	Passenger ID, Gender, Age
-	Customer Type (First time / Returning)
-	Type of Travel (Business / Personal)
-	Service Class
-	Flight Distance, Departure Delay, and Arrival Delay
-	Service Rating Metrics covering online booking, check-in, boarding, seat comfort, food and beverage, cleanliness, in-flight services, Wi-Fi, entertainment, and baggage handling
-	Overall Satisfaction (Satisfied / Neutral or Unsatisfied)
  
The dataset provides comprehensive information suitable for evaluating passenger experience and identifying key drivers of airline satisfaction.

### Data Cleaning and Processing ###
To ensure accurate and reliable insights, the dataset was reviewed for completeness, consistency, and quality. The cleaning process involved checking for missing values, incorrect data types, inconsistencies, and duplicate records. Overall, the dataset was well-structured, with standardized fields and valid entries.

Key steps taken during cleaning included:
-	Replacing zeros in service rating columns with NaN where they represented “Not Applicable.”
-	Verifying and correcting data types for numerical and categorical fields.
-	Confirming the absence of duplicate records.
-	Standardizing column names for clarity and consistency.
  
After these steps, the dataset was confirmed to be clean, consistent, and ready for analysis.
